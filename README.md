# HACK-HORIZON organized by ARKA JAIN UNIVERSITY OUR PROJECT IS "VIDYA"
Problem Statement: Collaborative Skill-Based EdTech Network
üåçContext: 
Students, professionals, and mentors often struggle to find the right collaborators for learning, building, or mentoring. Skills are scattered across platforms, and there's no unified space to form meaningful, goal-oriented teams in the EdTech space.

üß†Challenge: Design a platform where users can create skill-based profiles with interests, experiences, and past projects; search and filter other users based on project needs, technologies, or goals; form or join project teams, seek collaborators, or find mentors; enable mentors to browse potential mentees and offer guidance; and optionally integrate features like collaboration boards, feedback systems, and project showcases.

üéØGoal: To foster a dynamic community that bridges the gap between learners, builders, and mentors by enabling skill-based discovery, collaboration, and growth in one unified platform.
Professional Description
The proposed platform is a collaborative, startup-centric application designed to empower students and early-stage professionals by providing them with an integrated space to ideate, collaborate, and grow. Unlike conventional platforms such as LinkedIn, which are primarily job-oriented, this platform‚Äîtentatively named "Vidya"‚Äîfocuses on fostering innovation and entrepreneurship from the ground up.

Vidya serves as a nexus for aspiring entrepreneurs to share their startup ideas, connect with like-minded individuals, and receive mentorship from experienced professionals and incubators. Through comprehensive skill-based profiles, users can highlight their interests, expertise, and previous projects, facilitating meaningful connections based on complementary goals and competencies.

The platform enables users to search for and filter potential collaborators based on specific technologies, project requirements, or entrepreneurial ambitions. Additionally, it supports team formation, mentor-mentee interactions, and engagement with incubators, thus providing a robust ecosystem for startup development.

A key objective of this initiative is to contribute to India‚Äôs evolution into a global startup hub. It embodies the spirit of self-reliance and innovation by encouraging individuals not just to seek employment but to become creators of opportunities. Through features like collaborative workspaces, real-time feedback systems, and project showcases, Vidya aims to build a dynamic and inclusive community where every unique idea has the potential to flourish.
